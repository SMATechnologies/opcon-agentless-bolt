# OpCon Agent-less via Bolt
Provides a Job subtype to drive agentless workload on remote Windows and Linux systems using Bolt.

Bolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure. Use Bolt to automate tasks that you perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow. For example, you can use Bolt to patch and update systems, troubleshoot servers, deploy applications, or stop and restart services. Bolt can be installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.

Using Bolt it is possible to execute commands, scripts puppet tasks and upload files to Windows and Linux systems. 

Bolt uses SSH to connect to Linux systems and winrm to connect to Windows systems.

The Agentless (Bolt) subtype supports task definitions for Bolt and submits the tasks to Bolt passing any definied arguments.
