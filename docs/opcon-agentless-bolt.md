# OpCon Agent-less via Bolt
Provides a Job Sub-type **Agentless(Bolt)** to drive agentless workloads on remote Windows and Linux systems using Bolt.

![diagrm](/docs/images/Connectors_overview.png)


Bolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure. Use Bolt to automate tasks that you perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow. For example, you can use Bolt to patch and update systems, troubleshoot servers, deploy applications, or stop and restart services. Bolt can be installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.

Using Bolt it is possible to execute commands, scripts puppet tasks and upload files to Windows and Linux systems. 

Bolt uses SSH to connect to Linux systems and winrm to connect to Windows systems.

The Agentless (Bolt) subtype supports task definitions for Bolt and submits the tasks to Bolt passing any definied arguments. 

# Installation

Download and install the Bolt software as directed on either a Windows or Linux server (https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_installing.html).

Download the **Agentless(Bolt)** Job Sub-type, stop Enterprise Manager, copy the .jar file into the drop-ins directory and restart Enterprise Manager.

The Job Sub-type should be visible when selecting Windows or Unix job types. If this is not visible, restart the Enterprise Manager using 'Run as Administrator' for the initial time.

Create a global property **BOLT_PATH** that contains the full path of the BOLT binary installation directory.

# Instructions

## Supported Tasks
The opconcli program provides the following tasks:

- **command run**: execute a command on a remote Windows or Linux system.
- **script run**: execute a script on a remote Windows or Linux system. The script is downloaded to the remote system, executed and removed.
- **task run**: execute a pupprt task on a remote Windows or Linux system. The task information is downloaded to the remote system, executed and removed. 
- **file upload**: upload a file to a remote Windows or Linux system.

## Using the Agentless (Bolt) Job Sub-type

When using the Agentless Sub-Type select the required task from the Bolt Task drop-down list. Complete the definitions. Once a task is saved, Bolt Task cannot be changed.

### Remote Command
**Remote Command** is used to execute commands remotely on either a Windows or Linux system.

## Working with Bolt

Bolt tasks are similar to scripts, but they are kept in modules and can have metadata. 
You can write tasks in any programming language the targets run, such as Bash, PowerShell, or Python. A task can even be a compiled binary that runs on the target. Place your task in the ./tasks directory of a module and add a metadata file to describe parameters and configure task behavior.

For a task to run on remote *nix systems, it must include a shebang (#!) line at the top of the file to specify the interpreter.

You use a task name to interact with a task from the Bolt command line. For example, you can use bolt task run smaopconagents::unixagentcmd --targets localhost to run the smaopconagents::unixagentcmd task.

Task names are composed of one or two name segments, indicating:

    The name of the module where the task is located.

    The name of the task file, without the extension.

After creating your module, you will need to regitsre it with Bolt by running the bolt puppetfile command.
Add your module to the Puppetfile associated with your installation.

```

mod 'smaopconagents', local:true

```
	
###Some useful Bolt commands

command                    | Description
-----------------          | -----------
bolt task show             | displays a list of Bolt tasks available on your system
bolt task show <task-name> | displays the metadata associated with the task
bolt --help                | displays bolt help 
bolt --help <subcommand>   | displays bolt help about a specific command
bolt puppetfile install    | installs modules from a Puppetfile into a boltdir (required to register bolts tasks)
 
###Task

The following task **unixagentcmd** is used to perform operations on SMA OpCon Linux agents.
It requires 2 arguments port and command. The format for passing an argument to a Linux script is to prefix the argument with **$PT_** 

```
	
#!/bin/bash
cd /usr/local/lsam/bin
./lsam$PT_port $PT_command 


```
###Task metadata

Task metadata files describe task parameters, validate input, and control how Bolt executes the task.

For example, the module **smaopconagents** includes the **smaopconagents::unixagentcmd** task with the metadata file, **unixagentcmd.json**.
The **input_method** of the metadata defines how parameters are passed to the task (environment, stdin, powershell).

```
{
  "description":"Executes Unix Agent commands",
  "parameters":{
    "port":{
      "description":"the port number of the agent to execute",
      "type":"String"
      },
	"command":{
      "description":"the command to execute",
      "type":"Enum[start, stop, status]"
	  }
  },
  "input_method":"environment"
}  
```
